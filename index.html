        <h3 id="headline">Why XXXTentacion is the GOAT</h3>
        <ul>
          <p>His discography speaks for itself. He could go from conscious songs like "Riot" where he talks about race relations in America, a revolution and the etiquette of a riot, to "Save Me" where he’s singing his heart out like it’s a ballad in a chorus that’s reminiscent of a 70’s rock ballad, to songs like up like an "Insomniac" where he talks about feeding girls Xanax for dinner while incorporating enough flows to make Biggie Smalls proud.</p>

        He created a sound that embraces the versatility in current hip hop. Through that sound he cultivated a cult like fan base that made him the most streamed artist frequently even though he received no radio play until his untimely death.
          </p>
          <p>XXXTentacion spoke about topics that are hard to talk about and he did this through music, he touched a lot of peoples lives including mine.</p>
